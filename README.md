# Visualizing World Happiness with R

This project was a requirement for one of my classes during my Master's Data Science program at Bellevue Univeristy.

#### -- Project Status: `Completed`

## Project Intro/Objective
The primary purpose of this project is to work with a raw dataset and create visualizations measuring world happines metrics gathered during the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/)

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, K-Neighbors Regressor, Random Forest Regressor)
* Data Visualizaiton (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Summary Statistics

### Technologies Used
* R (ggplot2, tideyverse)
* R Studio (IDE for R scripts)

## Project Description
The first step of this project was data collection. The data set was collected from the World Happiness Report. Using R (and R Studio), the data was read into data frames and cleaned using functions provided by the collection of R packages in the tidyverse collection. Once the data was cleaned and processed, some basic data visualizations are were cleaned. Graphics created include: bar plots, count plots, distribution plots, etc.
